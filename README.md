##Introduction

NZ government has proposed to achieve a 97% (which is handled as 100% in this case study) renewable electricity generation system by 2035, without the use of fossil fuels. To satisfy the balance between power demand and supply in this proposed system, it is therefore of significance to extend the renewable supply, including geothermal, wind power and hydroelectricity. This report investigates the new system mathematically with a working simulation, focusing on its expected behavior within one year. Eulerâ€™s method is applied to determine some of the essential variables hourly. The viability is checked in the light of the lake level in both North and South Island, where a mass balance should be ensured. Further optimization will also be discussed.
